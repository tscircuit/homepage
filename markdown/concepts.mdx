# Overview

tscircuit is an ecosystem of tools for building circuits in React. In this guide,
we'll walk through the basics of running tscircuit. If you have any trouble,

# Concepts for Developers

Here are some helpful concepts if you're working on tscircuit as a developer.

* **tscircuit soup**: An intermediate JSON format that tscircuit typescript code
  compiles to. It contains all the elements of the circuit in their fully
  computed positions
  
  
## more on tscircuit soup

Most of the complex logic in tscircuit doesn't involve React at all. In the
[tscircuit/builder repo](https://github.com/tscircuit/builder) you can build
up circuits using a builder pattern and compile them to tscircuit soup. This
computes all routes, layouts and positions for both schematics and PCBs.
